PYRAMID_RULES = """
  - Discard exposed pairs of cards that add up to 13
    until pyramid is cleared or you're out of cards.
  - Exposed cards in the pyramid that are not overlapping
    or come from the top or the draw pile.
  - Draw 1 card at a time, which can be used for a pair
    until the next draw.
  - Aces = 1, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13

  """

KLONEDIKE_RULES = """
  - The object of the game is to build all the cards face up
    on the foundations. Each foundation builds upward,
    in sequence, from the ace to the king.
  - Only aces may be moved to an empty foundation, and only
    the next higher card of the same suit can be added to
    the foundation.
  - You advance the game by building on the face-up cards in
    the tableau in descending sequence of alternating colors.
    For example, only the 9 of hearts or diamonds (red suits)
    may play on the 10 of spades (a black suit).
  - Cards can be built on the tableau piles by moving them from
    another tableau pile or the top of the turned up cards from
    the deck.
  - Whenever the face-up cards in a column are moved, the
    uncovered face-down card becomes available to turn up.
    Only a king, or a sequence headed by a king, may be moved
    to an empty column.

"""

CLOVERS_RULES = """
  - Find a combination of cards with the same mark for a
    total of 15. Such cards can be removed.
  - J, Q, and K are not numbers, and when J, Q, and K are
    the same mark, all the three can be removed.
  - Aces = 1

"""


COUPLE_RULES = """
  - Cards that make up a pair (such as two Kings or two Sixes)
    are removed when they are immediately next to each other
    horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - Once some or all such pairs have been removed, the cards
    are consolidated, i.e. moving cards to the left as if
    towards the upper left corner to fill any gaps left behind
    by the discarded pairs. New cards are then laid out from
    the stock to form a fresh layout of 25 cards.
  - This process is repeated continues until it is no longer
    possible to remove pairs (e.g. in the finishing stages of
    the game one might be stuck with "4-6-4-6.").
    The game is won if all cards are successfully discarded.
